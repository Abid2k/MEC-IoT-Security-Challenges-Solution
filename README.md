# IoT Data Analysis with Random Forest Classifier

This repository contains Python code for training a random forest classifier on an IoT (Internet of Things) dataset. It also includes code to plot a confusion matrix and an ROC curve to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of IoT device data, including device type, location, firmware version, security vulnerabilities, data values, and labels (indicating anomalies)...

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required packages using `pip` with the following command:
